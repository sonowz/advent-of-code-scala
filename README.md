# Advent of Code Scala 3 Solution

This solution aims to write elegant FP style code.

Note: I am a Haskell programmer who is learning Scala with this AoC.

- Use `enum`s and `case class`es for better readablity and more strict typecheck
- Use immutable collections as much as possible
- Use `val` and avoid `var` as much as possible
- Prefer utilizing Scala base library over Cats
