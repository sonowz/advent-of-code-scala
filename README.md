# Advent of Code Scala 3 Solution

This solution aims to write elegant FP style code.

- Use `enum`s for better readablity and more strict typecheck
- Use type classes as much as possible
- Use pure functions (which never throw exception) only, except functions in input processing

# Instruction

```bash
# Runs code in year 2022, day 1 with input file stored in 'src/main/resources/' directory.
